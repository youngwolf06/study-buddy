Study Buddy
Study Buddy is a fully interactive web application designed to enhance focus, productivity, and engagement during study sessions. It provides a virtual study environment where users can navigate a digital “study room” and interact with different elements to access helpful tools and features.
The core features of Study Buddy include:
1. Virtual Assistant powered by ChatGPT: Ask questions, get explanations, or receive study tips from an AI assistant directly within the app. This makes studying more interactive and personalized.
2. To-Do List Manager: Keep track of your tasks with a built-in to-do list. Mark tasks as complete, add new tasks, and manage priorities seamlessly.
3. Calculator: A handy calculator integrated into the study environment for quick calculations without leaving the app.
4. Immersive Visual Experience: The app features a visually rich study room with background lighting effects, hotspots, and interactive areas. These elements create a dynamic and engaging environment that encourages focus.
5. Hotspots and Interactivity: Certain areas of the room, like the study buddy character, calculator, or to-do helper, act as interactive hotspots. Hovering or clicking on them reveals messages, tools, or AI assistance.
6. Safe and Private: Sensitive information like API keys is handled securely through environment variables, keeping user data and API credentials protected.
Study Buddy combines productivity tools and a gamified study environment, making it ideal for students, lifelong learners, or anyone who wants to make studying more engaging. It’s not just a tool—it’s an experience that transforms your study sessions into something interactive, fun, and productive.
